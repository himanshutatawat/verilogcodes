 # Lab #3: Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
In this lab you are required to implement an ALU on the FPGA board.
The ALU is an integral part of a processor in a computer that carries out the execution of various instructions. It performs Arithmetic operations as well as Logic operations on the two inputs and produces the output. 
The ALU is represented by the following.
 
# Dancing Lights
Lab #4: Dancing lights
In this lab you are required to handle the seven segment displays on the FPGA boards using sequence of operations. The following image is used as a reference in this lab.
                                      
# De Bouncing Lights
Switch de-bouncing. 
For a good description on the spring based switches and problems related to the bouncing of the spring can be found at http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/electronics/debounce.html. 

# Counters
In this lab you are required to handle the multiple different counters.
1.	Use 25MHz clock to generate such counters.
2.	Divide the frequency by 1M (220)) to get a frequency of about 25Hz.
3.	Use this clock to generate the following two counters.
Also Johnson Counter is included

# Microprocessor
In this module you need to implement a microprocessor with a register file and an ALU.
Just to refresh the ALU, the following is our ALU specifications. It had been used for the lab, in the quiz and in the class.
